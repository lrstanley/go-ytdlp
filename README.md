## :sparkles: Features

- CLI bindings for yt-dlp -- including all flags/commands.
- Optional `Install*` helpers to auto-download the latest supported version of
  yt-dlp, ffmpeg and ffprobe, including proper checksum validation for secure downloads (yt-dlp only).
  - Worry less about making sure yt-dlp is installed wherever **go-ytdlp** is running from!
- Carried over help documentation for all functions/methods.
- Flags with arguments have type mappings according to what the actual flags expect.
- Completely generated, ensuring it's easy to update to future **yt-dlp** versions.
- Deprecated flags are marked as deprecated in a way that should be caught by most IDEs/linters.
- Stdout/Stderr parsing, with timestamps, and optional JSON post-processing.

```
<!-- template:end:goget -->

## :clap: Examples

### Simple

See also [_examples/simple/main.go](./_examples/simple/main.go), which includes
writing results (stdout/stderr/etc) as JSON.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"

	"github.com/lrstanley/go-ytdlp"
)

func main() {
	// If yt-dlp isn't installed yet, download and cache it for further use.
	ytdlp.MustInstall(context.TODO(), nil)

	dl := ytdlp.New().
		FormatSort("res,ext:mp4:m4a").
		RecodeVideo("mp4").
		Output("%(extractor)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s")

	_, err := dl.Run(context.TODO(), "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

### Fancy UI using BubbleTea

This example shows how to use **go-ytdlp** and [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
to create a fancy, though relatively simple, UI for downloading videos.

## :package: Install Function(s) & Binary Management

The `Install*` function helpers in **go-ytdlp** allow you to automatically download and cache the
required binaries (`yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`, and `ffprobe`) for your platform. This makes it easy to get
started without manually installing these dependencies, and ensures the correct versions are used.

> **Note:** Download/installation of `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` is only supported on a handful of platforms.
> It is still recommended to install them via other means if your platform is not listed below.
